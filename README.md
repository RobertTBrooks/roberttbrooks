### Featured Projects

#### 🎮 Godot + FastAPI MMO Starter (Public Repo)

Basic multiplayer foundation for Godot projects using a FastAPI backend.  
Built as a clean starting point for future games or real-time applications that need live services. Just because it's Godot doesn’t mean it’s limited to offline games.

✅ Real-time player position synchronization (MMO-style updates)  
✅ Live WebSocket chat system with usernames  
✅ Secure login system using bcrypt password hashing  
✅ Active session tracking to prevent duplicate logins  
✅ FastAPI + WebSockets (Starlette) + SQLite backend  
✅ Lightweight, extensible architecture for co-op or persistent-world prototypes
